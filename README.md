#Advanced Web Programing - Assignment 4 - SFWRTECH4AI3 - McMaster University - Software Engineering

Primary Learning Objectives:
- Utilize NodeJS to respond to web requests.
- Use AJAX to asynchronously send and request data from a server.
Key Requirements:
- Start with provided starter code; use npm install and node server.js to run.
- Implement a search page (http://localhost:3000/search) that interacts with server-side scripts to fetch and display house listings.
- Incorporate AJAX requests to fetch data for:
  - All listings (/all)
  - Listings by number of bathrooms (/bathroom_search)
  - Listings by number of bedrooms (/bed_search)
  - Listings by price range (/price_search)
  - Listings by community (/community_search)
  - Use a form and table to display search filters and results, respectively.
  - Allow users to filter listings via UI elements (buttons, dropdowns for bedrooms and bathrooms, price range inputs).
  - Ensure that filtering is done server-side through AJAX requests; front-end only for display.
  - Style the page and elements using Bootstrap Version 5 and handle events and DOM updates with jQuery.
